We would like to reproduce the results of the paper

"Trading Convexity for Scalability"  Collobert  2006
http://www.kyb.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/attachments/icml_3917%5b0%5d.pdf

Which describes the CCCP-TSVM method , implemented in UniverSVM

The data set is a binary classification of the Reuters 2004 set
CCAT (corporate/industrial) vs GCAT (government/social)

I think this is the RCV1 dataset, available at
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/ref.html#DL04b

http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/yiming/Publications/rcv1_jmlr04.pdf

although this data set appears slightly different than what was used in the paper
and I dont know how to get the specific CCAT / GCAt from this set

the data may be available in raw form somewhere
